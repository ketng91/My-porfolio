                        Data analysis isn't a life cycle. It's the process of analyzing data.
                        Let's see each step of the data analysis process and how it will relate to the work of a data analyst.
                        <br>There are 6 steps of data analysis: <b><span style="color:rgb(7, 148, 230)">Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share & Act.</span></b>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br><img src="assets/images/dataprocess.png" alt="report" style="width:auto;height:400px;display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">

                        <br><b><span style="color:rgb(5, 136, 212)">Let's start with the first step in data analysis, the ask phase.</span></b>
                        <br>In this phase, we do 2 things. We define the problem to be solved and we make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations.
                        Let's break that down. First, defining a problem means you look at the current state and identify how it's different from the ideal state.
                        Usually there's an obstacle we need to get rid of or something wrong that needs to be fixed.
                        <br>Another important part of the ask phase is understanding stakeholder expectations. The first step here is to determine who the stakeholders are. 
                        That may include your manager, an executive sponsor, or your sales partners. There can be lots of stakeholders. 
                        But what they all have in common is that they help make decisions, influence actions and strategies, and have specific goals they want to meet. 
                        They also care about the project and that's why it's so important to understand their expectations.
                        <span style="color:rgb(5, 136, 212)">Communicating with your stakeholders is key in making sure you stay engaged and on track throughout the project.</span>
                        <br>So as a data analyst, developing strong communication strategies is very important. This part of the ask phase helps you keep 
                        focused on the problem itself, not just its symptoms.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b><span style="color:rgb(5, 136, 212)">Next, we'll move on to the prepare step.</span></b>
                        <br>This is where data analysts collect and store data they'll use for the upcoming analysis process. Notice that
                        there are the different types of data and we should identify which kinds of data are most useful for 
                        solving a particular problem. It's so important that data and results are objective and unbiased. 
                        In other words, <span style="color:rgb(5, 136, 212)">any decisions made from analysis should always be based on facts and be fair and impartial.</span>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b><span style="color:rgb(5, 136, 212)">Next is the process step.</span></b>
                        <br>Here, data analysts find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. 
                        This usually means cleaning data, transforming it into a more useful format, combining two or more datasets
                         to make information more complete and removing outliers, which are any data points that could skew the 
                         information. Check the data to make sure it's complete and correct. This phase is all about getting
                          the details right. So we'll also fix typos, inconsistencies, or missing and inaccurate data.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b><span style="color:rgb(5, 136, 212)">Then it's time to analyze.</span></b>
                        <br>Analyzing the data we've collected involves using tools to transform and organize that information so 
                        that we can draw useful conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.
                        <br> There are lots of powerful tools data analysts use in their work such as spreadsheets and
                         structured query language, or SQL, which is often pronounced "sequel."
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b><span style="color:rgb(5, 136, 212)">Let's move on to the exciting part - the share phase.</span></b>
                        <br> Here data analysts will interpret results and share them with others to help stakeholders 
                        make effective data-driven decisions. In the share phase, visualization is a data analyst's best friend. 
                        It is essential to getting others to understand what the data is telling about.
                        <br><span style="color:rgb(5, 136, 212)">With the right visuals, facts and figures become so much easier 
                            to see and complex concepts become easier to understand.</span>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b><span style="color:rgb(5, 136, 212)">For our final data analysis phase, we have act.</span></b>
                        <br>This is the exciting moment when the business takes all of the insights the data analyst have 
                        provided and puts them to work in order to solve the original business problem.
                        <br>
                        </p>
